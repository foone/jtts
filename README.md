# Journey to the Surface
It’s pyglet+OpenGL, it’s a small FPS with a story (and a twist! really! a crap one, yes, but a twist)


Since it was made for a 48-hour game jam (and I only get to use about 20 of those hours), the code is five kinds of crap.

There’s a bunch of places where I went “God, this is so, so wrong” but kept on hacking because I needed to get it done in time.


## Requirements:
To play it, you should just need Python 2.6, NumPy, and a video card that can do OpenGL. 
I’ve not tested on ~~Winders~~ or OS X, but in theory it should run just fine.
